	<p>
		Henry Lyle is a designer and maker. His work ranges from objects and interiors to architecture. Henry studied architecture at Liverpool and Cambridge before fulfilling his life long ambition to become a potter.<br> <br>

		During the recent pandemic, Henry built a pottery studio in his parents' garden. From here he will continue to add to the growing portfolio of work you see on this website as long as (a) the amateurishly put together slate roof sheltering his studio remains intact in spite of frequent southwesterly gales and (b) the ongoing global health emergency continues to provide the perfect excuse not to do anything more lucrative. <br> <br>

		For an up-to-date catalogue of available pieces, please do not hesitate to drop Henry an <a href="mailto:henry.lyle@hotmail.co.uk">email</a>.
